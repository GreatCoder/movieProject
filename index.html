        <h4>From <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_2:_Judgment_Day">Wikipedia</a>:</h4>

        <p>
            Terminator 2: Judgment Day (also referred to as Terminator 2 or T2) is a 1991 American science-fiction action film[4] co-written, produced and directed by James Cameron. The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Robert Patrick, with Edward Furlong also in its principal cast as John Connor. It is the sequel to the 1984 film The Terminator, and the second installment in the Terminator franchise. Terminator 2 follows Sarah Connor (Hamilton) and her ten-year-old son John (Furlong) as they are pursued by a new, more advanced Terminator, the liquid metal, shapeshifting T-1000 (Patrick), sent back in time to kill John Connor and prevent him from becoming the leader of the human resistance. A second, less advanced Terminator (Schwarzenegger) is also sent back in time to protect John.
